# Purpose of this fork

The purpose of this fork is ([as stated in the original one](https://github.com/janert/d3-for-the-impatient#contributing)) to provide an `npm` / `yarn` based installer to run a webserver for the book examples. 

Also, I'm planning to maintain and extend the example code, so any contribution to this repository is more than welcome.
